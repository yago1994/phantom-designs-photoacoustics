# phantom-designs-photoacoustics
This repository contains the 3D designs of the phantoms used in "The Development and Characterization of a Novel yet Simple 3D Printed-based Phantom to Validate Photoacoustic Contrast Agents"
and some of their variations that we don't mention in the paper. Please feel free to use the files and modify them to your convenience. 
The files are in different formats, you may choose the one most suited for your application. As an overview, .stl is the 
file you would want to use into a "slicer" software; it is the software that prepares the files for 3D printing. .step will
let you import the file into a variety of CAD editors and then make changes. I will be adding files with extension .sldprt 
& .f3d so that the files can be modified with SolidWorks and Fusion 360 respectively.
